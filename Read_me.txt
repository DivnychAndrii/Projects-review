This is a sample project for improving my Git and Python skills.  
Here you may find a list of different projects with the different difficulty level and my code and solutions for them. 
I`m learning all these stuff so would be thankful if you leave some comments on my solutions or give me some advice on how to improve my code.
All projects are sorted by folders and have their own ReadMe.txt files with description of what is the issue. 
Source for these problems is Jose Portilla "Python bootcamp" and his 100 projects to improve skills. Similar to Project Euler 
Welcome and I hope you may find here something helpful.
